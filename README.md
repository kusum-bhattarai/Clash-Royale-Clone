- **Card-based Mechanics:** Select and manage cards to build effective strategies.
- **Dynamic Arena:** Engage in battles on a dynamically simulated battlefield.

## Technologies Used
- **C++:** Core language for implementing game mechanics.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** For modular and scalable code design.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Efficient management of game states and player actions.
